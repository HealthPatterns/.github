# Under Construction

We are currently in the process of moving our private repository for the HealthPatterns application to a public repository under this GitHub organization licensed via MIT. It should appear in the next few days, once the private repo owner has access to his laptop to transfer the project.

# Update

The repository has been moved and is now officialy open sourced under the MIT license. We look forward to keep working on Health Patterns!
